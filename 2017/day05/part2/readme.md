## --- Part Two ---

Now, the jumps are even stranger: after each jump, if the offset was __three or more__, instead __decrease__ it by ``1``. Otherwise, increase it by ``1`` as before.

Using this rule with the above example, the process now takes ``10`` steps, and the offset values after finding the exit are left as ``2 3 2 3 -1``.

__How many steps__ does it now take to reach the exit?
