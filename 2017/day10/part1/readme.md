## --- Day 10: Knot Hash ---

You come across some programs that are trying to implement a software emulation of a hash based on knot-tying. The hash these programs are implementing isn't very strong, but you decide to help them anyway. You make a mental note to remind the Elves later not to invent their own cryptographic functions.

This hash function simulates tying a knot in a circle of string with 256 marks on it. Based on the input to be hashed, the function repeatedly selects a span of string, brings the ends together, and gives the span a half-twist to reverse the order of the marks within it. After doing this many times, the order of the marks is used to build the resulting hash.

```
  4--5   pinch   4  5           4   1
 /    \  5,0,1  / \/ \  twist  / \ / \
3      0  -->  3      0  -->  3   X   0
 \    /         \ /\ /         \ / \ /
  2--1           2  1           2   5
```

To achieve this, begin with a __list__ of numbers from `0` to `255`, a __current position__ which begins at 0 (the first element in the list), a __skip size__ (which starts at `0`), and a sequence of __lengths__ (your puzzle input). Then, for each length:

- __Reverse__ the order of that __length__ of elements in the __list__, starting with the element at the __current position__.
- __Move__ the __current position__ forward by that __length__ plus the __skip size__.
- __Increase__ the __skip__ size by one.

The __list__ is circular; if the __current position__ and the __length__ try to reverse elements beyond the end of the list, the operation reverses using as many extra elements as it needs from the front of the list. If the __current position__ moves past the end of the list, it wraps around to the front. __Lengths__ larger than the size of the list are invalid.

Here's an example using a smaller list:

Suppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements, `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`, and were given input lengths of `3, 4, 1, 5`.

- The list begins as `[0] 1 2 3 4` (where square brackets indicate the current position).
- The first length, `3`, selects `([0] 1 2) 3 4` (where parentheses indicate the sublist to be reversed).
- After reversing that section (`0 1 2` into `2 1 0`), we get `([2] 1 0) 3 4`.
- Then, the current position moves forward by the length, `3`, plus the skip size, 0: `2 1 0 [3] 4`. Finally, the skip size increases to `1`.


- The second length, `4`, selects a section which wraps: `2 1) 0 ([3] 4`.
- The sublist `3 4 2 1` is reversed to form `1 2 4 3`: `4 3) 0 ([1] 2`.
- The current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size, a total of `5`, causing it not to move because it wraps around: `4 3 0 [1] 2`. The skip size increases to `2`.


- The third length, `1`, selects a sublist of a single element, and so reversing it has no effect.
- The current position moves forward by the length (`1`) plus the skip size (`2`): `4 [3] 0 1 2`. The skip size increases to `3`.


- The fourth length, `5`, selects every element starting with the second: `4) ([3] 0 1 2`. Reversing this sublist (`3 0 1 2 4` into `4 2 1 0 3`) produces: `3) ([4] 2 1 0`.
- Finally, the current position moves forward by `8`: `3 4 2 1 [0]`. The skip size increases to `4`.

In this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being `3` and `4`; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce `12`.

However, you should instead use the standard list size of `256` (with values `0` to `255`) and the sequence of __lengths__ in your puzzle input. Once this process is complete, __what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list__?
