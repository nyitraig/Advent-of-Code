## --- Part Two ---

You're not sure what it's trying to paint, but it's definitely not a __registration identifier__. The Space Police are getting impatient.

Checking your external ship cameras again, you notice a white panel marked "emergency hull painting robot starting panel". The rest of the panels are __still black__, but it looks like the robot was expecting to __start on a white panel__, not a black one.

Based on the Space Law Space Brochure that the Space Police attached to one of your windows, a valid registration identifier is always __eight capital letters__. After starting the robot on a single __white panel__ instead, __what registration identifier does it paint__ on your hull?
